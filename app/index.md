Bonjour! My name is Mauro, software engineer, cyclist and sport enthusiast. On my personal page you find information about me, Mauro Carabotti, and some blog posts about software and more.

My native language is french, but I live and work in the German speaking part of Switzerland since 2009, that's why I write in English... but also because more people understand it.

I enjoy writing well structured and efficient code. My programming languages of choice are Java, JavaScript and Bash. In the past I used to code in C# and Delphi but I don't do that any more. I am currently Software Engineer at [Puzzle ITC](http://puzzle.ch) in Bern, Switzerland.

## Cycling
I enjoy riding all kind of bicycles but most of the time it's on a road bike or a mountain bike. 

Some of my race results are available on [Datasport](http://services.datasport.com/myDSinfo.htm?acode=2518US5CL&r=1204.4516290328465), but now I prefer to ride without competition.
