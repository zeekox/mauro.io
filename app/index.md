title: Mauro Carabotti, Software Engineer & Cyclist

Bonjour! My name is Mauro, software engineer, cyclist and human (order is not relevant). On my personal page you find information about me, Mauro Carabotti, and some blog posts about software and more. 

I enjoy writing well structured and efficient code. My programming languages of choice are Java, Python and Typescript. In the past I used to code in C# and Delphi but I don't do that any more.

- [Certified ScrumMaster](http://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/mcarabotti) certificate

## Cycling
I enjoy riding all kind of bicycles but most of the time it's on a road bike or a mountain bike. 

Some of my race results are available on [Datasport](https://www.datasport.com/en/mydssearch/), but now I prefer to ride without competition.
