title: Mauro Carabotti, Software Engineer & Cyclist

Bonjour! I'm *Mauro*, software engineer, cyclist and sport enthusiast. On my personal page you find information about me, *Mauro Carabotti*, and some blog posts about software and more. 

My native language is french, but I live and work in the German speaking part of Switzerland since 2009, that's why I write in English... but also because more people understand it.
