title: Mauro Carabotti, Software Engineer & Cyclist
---
Bonjour! I'm Mauro, software engineer, cyclist and sport enthusiast. On my personal page you find information about me, Mauro Carabotti, and some blog posts about software and more. 

My native language is french, but I live and work in the German speaking part of Switzerland since 2009, that's why I write in English... but also because more people understand it.

I mainly speak Java, Javascript, SQL, Bash, HTML5 and CSS3. And Ruby and Python(s) don't make me afraid. In the past I expressed myself in C# and Delphi but I don't do that any more.
