Bonjour! My name is Mauro, software engineer, cyclist and sport enthusiast. On my personal page you find information about me, Mauro Carabotti, and some blog posts about software and more. 

I enjoy writing well structured and efficient code. My programming languages of choice are Java, Python and JavaScript. In the past I used to code in C# and Delphi but I don't do that any more.

## Cycling
I enjoy riding all kind of bicycles but most of the time it's on a road bike or a mountain bike. 

Some of my race results are available on [Datasport](http://services.datasport.com/myDSinfo.htm?acode=2518US5CL&r=1204.4516290328465), but now I prefer to ride without competition.
