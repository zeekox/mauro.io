During the search of fonts for this website I came across the following fonts I liked but didn't use:

- [Playfair Display](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Playfair+Display)
- [Poiret One](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Poiret+One) sans-serif
- [Domine](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Domine)
- [Cinzel](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cinzel)
- [Alike](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alike)

By the way I chose those:

- [Robot Slab](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Slab) for paragraphs
- [Sanchez](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Sanchez) for titles
